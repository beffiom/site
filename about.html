   	<h2>beliefs</h2>
   	<h3>minimalism</h3>
   	<p>The process of taking the time to acknowledge what it is we truly value and cutting out all the extra noise. It turns out most humans need very little more materially than their basic necessities (food, water, warmth, shelter, etc.) to live a happy and fulfilled life. In fact, the excess of material possessions can often decrease one's mental wellbeing by increasing the amount of worry, stress, fear, anxiety, and feelings of inadequacy (caused by comparing ourselves to others using money, status, and material possessions as metrics).</p>

   	<h3>veganism</h3>
   	<p>I believe it is morally wrong to cause intentional and unnessecary suffering. Animals are sentient beings meaning they have the ability to suffer. We, as humans, have no necessary reason to eat animals unless we would otherwise starve. Luckily, a lot of us live in abundant Western societies that afford us the option to achieve all of our necessary nutrients without consuming animals or their byproducts. For these reasons, I choose not to financially support industries that depend on the suffering of animals (dairy, meat, egg, or leather, etc.)</p>

   	<h3>freedom</h3>
	<p>
   	<ol>
   	     <li>the ability to say no to do things you don't want to do</li>
   	     <li>a lack of dependence on others and complex systems</li>
   	     <li>a lack of monetary and mental restrictions</li>
   	</ol>
	</p>
