read my blog and see my favorite books, anime, software, and books

hosted at: https://beffiom.tech

## technologies

vanilla html and css (no libraries or frameworks) +  javascript (jquery)

## features

* css keyframe animations on load (fade in transition)
* jquery show/hide for section navigation on button clicks
* jquery fade out/fade in transitions on section load
* dynamically loads article and book lists from external JSON files
* dynamically loads my manga and anime lists by making http requests to the graphql api from [anilist.co](https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/overview/graphql/getting-started)

## issues

* anime/manga list text doesn't properly center on some mobile devices (css is kinda toxic)
